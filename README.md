  How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      Testing in multiple forms is the only way to have any reliable confidence in a program being functional and secure.
  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      Requirements gathering and then making appropriate documents that convert the user needs into technical requirements of the        program. The rest is just following best practice to accomplish the laid out requirements.
  How do I approach designing software?
    Designing software should be done with a clear idea of what a program should be doing and then be broken down into smaller         tasks to meet said idea.
